### NordAsp

**“NordAsp”** is a study of natural variation in along a northern Scandinavian transect from the Norwegian coast (and Iceland) in the West to the northern Swedish coast in the East, at 64 to 66 °N. We are interested in variation in the genomes of different aspen individuals, to understand how their different characteristics, such as growth, specialised metabolism and phenology, are governed by variation in their DNA. 

We have collected pieces of roots from 1107 wild aspen trees in this geographic region, which will be propagated (cloned) into new plants and grown in a common environment for comparison. This common environment (common garden) will be in Umeå, and we hope to have another common garden in Steinkjer in Norway. 
We drove the width of northern Scandinavia and stopped beside wild aspen trees and took pieces of root for the propagation. We stored the geographic coordinates of the wild trees so that we can relate them, and the climate metadata associated with those coordinates, to the genetic characteristics of the trees. 

This app maps those coordinates and gives us valuable information about the original location of the trees.

Special thanks to all the people from *Umeå Plant Science Center (UPSC)* and *Sveriges lantbruksuniversitet (SLU)* who helped with colleting root samples. 
Different sections were planed for sampling and several people from *Umeå Plant Science Center (UPSC)*
